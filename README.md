# password-randomizer

## Description

The purpose of this website is so I can have a random password generator that will generate a random secure password with specifications that the user inputs.(aka uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.) 

## Usage

To use this website the user needs to specify what they want the password length to be (8-128) as well as what it will include. The user can do so by selecting what boxes they want to be included and what they dont want included and finally clicking "Generate" a random secure password will be produced. By clicking the "Clear" button the password that was generated will clear.
